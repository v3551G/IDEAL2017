															Some of the recent advances in machine learning and classification algorithms  are reviewed with a focus on new classification algorithms developed by the author and his associates including the Enhanced Probabilistic Neural Networks (EPNN) of Ahmadlou and Adeli and the Neural Dynamic Classification (NDC) algorithm devel-oped recently by Rafiei and Adeli (2017) based on the robust patented neural dynamics optimization model of Adeli and Park. Recent applications of the Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), EPNN, and NDC are presented from both engineering and medical fields such as computer-aided diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, earthquake early warn-ing systems, and damage detection in highrise building structures.

															Hojjat Adeli received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1976 at the age of 26. He has authored over 590 research and scientific publications including 16 books in vari-ous fields of computer science, engineering, applied mathematics, and medicine. In 1998 he received the Distinguished Scholar Award, from The Ohio State University (OSU) “in recognition of extraordinary accomplishment in research and scholarship”. He is the recipient of numerous other awards and honors such as the OSU College of Engineering Lumley Outstanding Research Award (quadruple winner); Peter L. and Clara M. Scott Award for Excellence in Engineering Education, and Charles E. MacQuigg Outstanding Teaching Award, a Special Medal from The Polish Neural Network Society in Recognition of Outstanding Contribution to the Development of Computational Intelligence, Eduardo Renato Caianiello Award for Excellence in Scien-tific Research from the Italian Society of Neural Networks and an Honorary Doctorate from Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Lithuania. He is the Founder and Edi-tor-in-Chief of Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, now in 32nd year of publication and Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering, now in 25th year of publi-cation. He is also the Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Neural Systems. He is a Distinguished Member of ASCE, and a Fellow of AAAS, IEEE, AIMBE, and Ameri-can Neurological Association.

                                                            To achieve desired analysis results, data analysis traditionally repeats the following process: Data analytic professionals work together domain experts to carefully select the data and the analysis models, and then apply analysis tools. With the rapid growth of data volume, and the emergence of new data, applications increasingly need to use "dark data” (or unfamiliar data) in addition to familiar, domain-specific data. At the same time, the demand for data analysis in various areas is increasing rapidly, creating a severe shortage of professional data analysts. As a result, data analysis is experiencing two changes: (1) The data used in analysis is changing from mostly domain-specific data to data from multiple, often unfamiliar, sources; (2) Data analysis practitioners are changing from only computer scientists or statisticians and other technical experts to experts in the application domains. Therefore, how to provide tools that will help user in their analysis tasks has become an important research subject. This talk will discuss the possibility in providing such tools that are collectively called "intelligent data analysis system”, and introduce several preliminary attempts.

															Big data refers to the datasets that are so large that conventional database management and data analysis tools are insufficient to work with them. Big data has become a bigger-than-ever problem with the quick developments of data collection and storage technologies. Model simplification is one of the most popular approaches to big data processing. After a brief tutorial of the existing techniques of processing big data, this talk will present some key issues of learning from big data with uncertainty, focusing on the impact of handling uncertainty and the challenges uncertainty brings to big data learning. It shows that the representation, measure, and handling of the uncertainty have a significant influence on the performance of learning from big data. Some new advances in our Big Data Institute regarding the research on big data analysis and its applications to different domains are briefly introduced.

                                                            We are in the era of data science and analytics. While data analytics have been explored from different disciplinary perspectives, most existing analytical and learning systems have been built on assuming that data is independent and identically distributed
                                                            (IID). Very few people pay attention to the potential issues with the corresponding results, which may be incomplete, misleading or incorrect. A foundational issue in data science and analytics is to understand the non-IID nature of data,
                                                            business and behavior, while limited knowledge is available in the literature. This talk briefly reviews the issues of existing learning systems, followed by the concepts, fundamentals and examples of non-IIDness learning. The second part
                                                            of the talk presents a summary of enterprise analytics practices of the speaker’s team, involving diversified domains. Personal thoughts of future data science research directions are provided to conclude the talk.

                                                            Security is a critical concern around the world, whether it’s the challenge of protecting ports, airports and other critical national infrastructure, or protecting wildlife and forests, or suppressing crime in urban areas. In many of these cases, limited
                                                            security resources prevent full security coverage at all times; instead, these limited resources must be scheduled, avoiding schedule predictability, while simultaneously taking into account different target priorities, the responses of the
                                                            adversaries to the security posture and potential uncertainty over adversary types. Computational game theory can help design such unpredictable security schedules and new algorithms are now deployed over multiple years in multiple applications
                                                            for security scheduling. These applications are leading to real-world use-inspired research in computational game theory in scaling up to large-scale problems, handling significant adversarial uncertainty, dealing with bounded rationality
                                                            of human adversaries, and other interdisciplinary challenges. This talk will discuss some recent research progress on computational game theory for security based on results published at recent AAMAS/AAAI/IJCAI conferences.
